# Artist statement

My work is an invitation to look closer at the intricate details of the living world, to see with new eyes. Working mainly in metals, using a jeweler's methods and a scientist's trained perception, I aim to capture the astonishing details of life—most often small, from insects down to single cells, and most often familiar—in ways that inspire wonder. These sculptures, rendered in lasting materials, allow you to touch the often untouchable, to hold and explore ife that is too small, skittish, or fragile to experience a human's tactile senses. My intention is to create wonder in both senses: awe, and curiosity.
