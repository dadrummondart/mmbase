A female <i>Tenodera sinensis</i> praying mantis. Her raptorial forelegs are articulated at the shoulder and wrist, allowing her needle-sharp claws to be sheathed or exposed. Tiny embedded rare-earth magnets hold her claws folded, making a satisfying click as her forelegs snap into place. Her head also swivels on a rare-earth magnet, mimicking the mantis's unique capability, in the insect world, to turn its head 180 degrees. Her waist also pivots gently left and right.
