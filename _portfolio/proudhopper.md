A planthopper with a prominent proboscis. Modeled after the genus Fulgoridae, this planthopper's snout is actually the top of his head; his true proboscis, used for feeding on plant sap, is the long needle-like structure held underneath his body.

Planthoppers are terrific jumpers. Jumping straight requires synchronization of the two powerful back legs. To link their motion, at the base of each hind leg (in the nymph stage) is a toothed gear with its teeth enmeshed in those of the opposite leg. Proudhopper has these gears between his back legs as well, if you flip him over and look very closely.
