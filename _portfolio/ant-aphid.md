A carpenter ant worker, <i>Camponotus</i> species. She (all ant workers are female) is rendered in extreme detail, down to the millimeter-width maxillary and labial palps in her mouth, hidden behind her formidable mandibles.


Fourteen pieces of cast bronze assembled with nuts, bolts, and two rare-earth magnets.
