A female thorn-mimic treehopper, a true bug (Hemiptera), <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbonia_crassicornis'><i>Umbonia</i></a> species. Treehoppers come in an astonishing array of shapes and sizes, mostly achieved by changes in the shape of their pronotum, the part of their carapace starting just behind the head. Often, as here, the apparent purpose is crypsis, hiding from birds and other predators by blending in with vegetation.

First edition: Seven cast pieces (three bronze, four silver). Second edition: Eleven pieces of cast metal (seven bronze pieces, four 925 sterling silver wings) assembled with nuts and bolts.
